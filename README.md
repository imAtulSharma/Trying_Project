# Wallet Algorithm

This is an algorithm to be made for use in a different android based projects.

## What the algorithm actually do
There are some type of coins to the user and we have to deduct an amount from the wallet (Which have different type of coins i.e. miniWallet).
First of all we deduct a specific amount from the mini wallets according to the percentages defined to satisfy the total amount need.
And if the amount is not satisfied from the given percentage then we can deduct amount from any type of wallet.
But we put a restriction to a particular wallet to deduct only the percentage described and not more than that.

## How to use this
You can simply change the percentage array and mini wallet array and can give the total amount to be deducted from the mini wallets.

## Result of algorithm
Returns true if the amount need is satisfied otherwise false.
